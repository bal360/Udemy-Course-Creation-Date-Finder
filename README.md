# Udemy-Course-Creation-Date-Finder

Ever get a little frustrated when you are working your way through a Udemy course and start to encouter issues based on outdated code that is being taught? 
As many of us Udemy customers know, it is impossible to easily find when a course was created directly on their website. 
Indeed this seems intentional, as many of us would almost certainly not purchase a given course if we knew it was created 3+ years ago.
The only related information that is easy to find is when a course was last updated. That can be incredibly misleading though
because even the most minor of changes to a course will reflect a recent update date and gives the impression that the course
overall contains up-to-date material.
I'm aware of how quickly things change in this industry and because of that I do sympathize with those Udemy instructors have spent weeks or months 
contructing a quality course, only to have certain parts of their code base break within a year because of updates to some particular languages, tools, 
dependencies, etc that they might be using.
With that said, I think we as the consumers deserve as much transparency as possible when deciding where to spend our time and money.
To ensure we are all making the most informed decision possible when buying a new Udemy course, I decided to whip up a little application that
can quickly tell you when a particular course was first created, not when it was last updated.

Deployment and Steps to use coming soon...
