# Udemy Course Creation Date Finder

To ensure we are all making the most informed decision possible when buying a new Udemy course, I decided to whip up a little application that
can quickly tell you when a particular course was first created, not when it was last updated.

Some updates and refactoring to this ugly code are definitely needed, but it works as is for now. So enjoy!

Please watch this short video to learn the current steps you need to know to use this app:
